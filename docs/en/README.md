## Usage
To use this on a Custom Form use the following
```
$form->enableSpamProtection();
```

To use these on the UserForms module you can select them from the dropdowns. For both fields you can leave the title empty.

- Honeypot Field: Honeypot Spam Protection Field
- Timer Field: Timer Spam Protection Field (default value is automatically added on form load)
